/**
 * This type of sorting is generally applied when we have a huge dataset
 * but the memory is less.
 * For Example : Lets say we have 9 elements and now we want to sort them.
 * However our memory can only hold 3 elements.
 * In such case divide the whole data into smaller chunks of 3 elements. 
 * Sort these smaller chunks.
 * Once they are sorted take the first element from each sorted list and put it in the memory.
 * Print the smallest of them. Take the next element from the array from which we have just 
 * printed the element.
 * Continue like this and you will have a sorted array.
