 * Bucket sort is a sorting technique in which we will be having a large set.
 * However this set will not be distributed over a very large key range.
 * In this we will create few buckets(empty arrays or linked lists).
 * We will the iterate over the large data set and assign some values to some buckets.
 * Once all the data is over we will sort the buckets internally may be using insertion sort
 * Lastly we will combine all the buckets back to the large data set.
