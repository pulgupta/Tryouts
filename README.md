#Synopsis

This project contains most of the concepts around Core Java. In this I have tried to cover almost all the topics from the very easy to advanced concepts like threading, executor framework etc.

##Code Example
Each major topic is divided into packages. Please navigate through the code to better understand the layout. As most of the codes are plain java you can just simply run it under your IDE.

##Deployment
As most of the samples are just basic core Java examples you can run most of the code in Eclipse or anyother IDE itself.
